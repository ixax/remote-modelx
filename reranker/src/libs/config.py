"""config.yml schema + loading for the reranker service.

Reading the file itself is yaml_config's load_raw_config -- this module
just supplies RerankerConfig as the schema. Validation happens in two
steps here, not via load_yaml_config's one-shot helper: "model" isn't in
config.yml at all -- server.py fills it in from RERANKER_MODEL on the raw
dict returned by load_config(), then calls .validate(RerankerConfig).
